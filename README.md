## Introduction

In this SQL project, we will analyze a supermarket database, applying essential SQL concepts such as basic queries, aggregation, date and time functions, join operations, subqueries, and window functions.

### Business Questions

These are SQL analysis business questions for this project and they will be categorized and addressed according to their respective concepts.

1. Basic Queries
    + Retrieve all product names and their categories from the Products table.
    + List all items with a loss rate greater than 5% from the Loss_Rates table.
    + Find products listed in the Sales table that do not exist in the Products table.
1. Aggregation Functions
    + Calculate the average wholesale price of each category of products.
    + Find the total sales for each item in the Sales table.
    + Display the item name along with its loss rate.
1. Date and Time Functions
    + List the total sales quantity for each month.
    + Find the product that had the highest sales in terms of quantity on a given date.
1. Join Operations
    + Determine the average loss rate for each category.
    + Find the total sales for each category of products.
1. Subqueries
    + Identify products that have a higher loss rate than the average loss rate of their respective category.
    + List the top 3 products with the highest sales in each category.
1. Window Functions
    + Calculate the running total of sales for each product over time.
    + Identify the top-selling product (based on the total quantity sold) in each category.
1. Complex Queries
    + Calculate the month-over-month growth rate in sales for each product category.
    + Find the day with the highest total sales for each product and the corresponding sale amount.
    + For each category, indicate whether the total sales quantity in the most recent month increased or decreased compared to the previous month. Use 'Up', 'Down', or 'Stable' to represent the trend.
    + Calculate the average wholesale price for each category and the percentage variation from the overall average wholesale price across all categories.

### About Database

You could find the dataset that used in this database originates from [supermarket-sales-data](www.kaggle.com/datasets/yapwh1208/supermarket-sales-data).

The dataset consists of four interconnected tables:

+ Products: Holds unique records for each product, including an identifier, item code, name, and category details.
+ Sales: Records individual sales transactions, detailing the product sold (linked by item code), the date and time of sale, quantity, unit sale price, type of transaction (sale or return), and any discounts applied.
+ Prices: Tracks the wholesale prices of products over time, identified by the item code and date.
+ Loss Rates: Records the loss rates of products, identified by the item code and name.

#### Database Relationship

## Data Cleaning

From the business questions, we can see only two questions are related to ensuring data quality.

Which are:

+ Retrieve all product names and their categories from the Products table
+ Find products listed in the Sales table that do not exist in the Products table.

### Retrieve all product names and their categories from the Products table

```sql

SELECT
    DISTINCT item_name AS ProductName,
    category_name AS CategoryName
FROM products
ORDER BY item_name ASC;

```

![Retrieve all product names and their categories from the Products table](output/img/data_cleaning_1.png)

For csv file you can find it [here](output/csv/data_cleaning_1.csv).

### Find products listed in the Sales table that do not exist in the Products table

```sql

SELECT
    a.item_code
FROM sales a
LEFT JOIN products b
    ON a.item_code = b.item_code
WHERE b.item_code IS NULL;

```

![Find products listed in the Sales table that do not exist in the Products table](output/img/data_cleaning_2.png)

For csv file you can find it [here](output/csv/data_cleaning_2.csv).

#### Data Cleaning Summary

+ There are 248 rows of products with its category in the Products table.
+ All products listed in the Sales table exist in the Products table.

## Data Analysis

    + List all items with a loss rate greater than 5% from the Loss_Rates table.
    + Determine the average loss rate for each category.
    + Identify products that have a higher loss rate than the average loss rate of their respective category.
1. Wholesale_Prices
    + Calculate the average wholesale price of each category of products.
    + Calculate the average wholesale price for each category and the percentage variation from the overall average wholesale price across all categories.
1. Sales
    + Find the total sales for each item in the Sales table.
    + Find the total sales for each category of products.
    + List the top 3 products with the highest sales in each category.
    + Identify the top-selling product (based on the total quantity sold) in each category.
    + Find the day with the highest total sales for each product and the corresponding sale amount.
    + List the total sales quantity for each month.
    + Find the product that had the highest sales in terms of quantity on a given date.
    + Calculate the running total of sales for each product over time.
    + Calculate the month-over-month growth rate in sales for each product category.
    + For each category, indicate whether the total sales quantity in the most recent month increased or decreased compared to the previous month. Use 'Up', 'Down', or 'Stable' to represent the trend.
